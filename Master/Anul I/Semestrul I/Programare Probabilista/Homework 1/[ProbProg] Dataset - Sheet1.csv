Chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds.
"Chemistry is the scientific discipline involved with elements and compounds composed of atoms, chemistry molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances."
"In a covalent bond, chemistry, one or more pairs of valence electrons are shared by two atoms: the resulting electrically neutral group of bonded atoms is termed a molecule."

"Physics is the natural science that studies matter, its motion and behavior through space and time, and that studies the related entities of energy and force."
"Classical physics is generally concerned with matter and energy on the normal scale of observation, while much of modern physics is concerned with the behavior of matter and energy under extreme conditions or on a very large or very small scale."
"Contemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into nuclear and particle physics; condensed matter physics; atomic, molecular, and optical physics; astrophysics; and applied physics."

"Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language."
Philosophers also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? existence god philosophy question
"Issues include the existence of God, philosophy the relationship between reason and faith, questions of philosophy religious epistemology, the relationship between religion and science, how to interpret religious experiences, questions about the possibility of an afterlife, the problem of religious language and the existence of souls and responses to religious pluralism and diversity."

"Today the range of fields of study examining the economy revolves around the social science of economics, but may include sociology (economic sociology), history (economic history), anthropology (economic anthropology), and geography (economic geography)."
"An economy is an area of the production, distribution and trade, as well as consumption of goods and services by different agents."
"A market-based economy is one where goods and services are produced and exchanged according to demand and supply between participants (economic agents) by barter or a medium of exchange with a credit or debit value accepted within the network, such as a unit of currency."

"Photography is the art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either Photography electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film."
"Photography Photographers control the camera and lens to expose the light recording material to the required amount Photography of light to form a latent image (on plate or film) or RAW file (in digital cameras) which, after appropriate processing, is converted to a usable image."
"Photographs, Photography both monochrome and color, can be captured and displayed through two side-by-side images that emulate human stereoscopic vision."

"Geography is a field of science devoted to the study of the lands, features, inhabitants, and phenomena of the Earth and planets."
"The latter examines the natural environment, geography and how organisms, climate, soil, water, and landforms produce and interact."
Physical geography (or physiography) focuses on geography as an Earth science.

"History also includes the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a sequence of past events, History and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them."
"The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation. Often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in university studies."
